We propose an information theoretically secure secret-key quantum money scheme in which the
verification of a coin is classical and consists of only one round; namely, a classical query from the
user to the bank and an accept/reject answer from the bank to the user. A coin can be verified
polynomially (on the number of its qubits) many times before it expires. Our scheme is an improvement
on Gavinsky's scheme, where three rounds of interaction are needed and is based on the
notion of quantum retrieval games.
Moreover, we propose a public-key quantum money scheme which uses one-time memories as
a building block and is computationally secure in the random oracle model. This construction is
derived naturally from our secret-key scheme using the fact that one-time memories are a special case
of quantum retrieval games.
