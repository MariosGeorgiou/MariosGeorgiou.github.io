I am a member of the choir of the Pancyprian Association of America based in Astoria, New York. Last October we [accompanied](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHO4e8YG5II&t=6223s) the famous Greek singer Michalis Violaris!

A decade ago I used to play and teach the piano. [This](https://cuny547-my.sharepoint.com/:v:/g/personal/mgeorgiou_gradcenter_cuny_edu/EbtDoeF7qqFNnunpuGGckh0BV2-Yj_eXDrMs_19Jz1BmxA?e=ClXTiu) is me in 2009 playing a Chopin etude (0:14) and a Chopin Scherzo (13:50). [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ptzuwc57JTA) is a song we played with my former band Eclipsis in my hometown Metamorfosis, Greece.
