Hi! I am a PhD Candidate working on Cryptography. I am very grateful to have [Nelly Fazio](http://www-cs.ccny.cuny.edu/~fazio/)  as my advisor. Before joining CUNY, I received my [Master in Computer Science](https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php) from Paris 7 Diderot under the supervision of [Iordanis Kerenidis](https://www.irif.fr/~jkeren/jkeren/Iordanis_Kerenidis.html). Before that, I studied [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) at the National Technical University of Athens and was a member of [CoReLab](http://corelab.ntua.gr/).
